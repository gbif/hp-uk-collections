    # Benefits of UK natural science collections
    
    ## Scientific Benefits
    Natural science collections are a critical resource for scientists advancing
    knowledge that informs challenging global issues including climate change,
    biodiversity conservation, resourcing the green economy and our response to
    pandemics such as COVID-19.
    
    ## Societal Benefits
    Natural science collections connect and empower society, inspiring a lifelong love
    of nature, are the source of educational material for generations and provide
    communities with data and knowledge, as well as involving them in its creation and
    interpretation.
    
    ## Economic Benefits
    Digitisation of natural science digitisation has the potential to deliver a tenfold
    return on investment, creating benefits in excess of Â£2 billion over 30 years.
