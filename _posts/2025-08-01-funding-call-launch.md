The first DiSSCo UK funding call [is live](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/digitise-uk-natural-science-collections/) and will close on 16th September.  

Information about the call, including how to apply, the scope of the call, and what your proposal should include, can be found on the [UKRI website](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/digitise-uk-natural-science-collections/). In addition, detailed digitisation guidance is available on the [DiSSCo UK website](https://dissco-uk.org/funding-guidance/). This aims to help you plan and budget your digitisation project, with recommendations for expected equipment, staff, and data standards.  

AHRC are holding a series of online workshops this summer to explain the funding call process and criteria, and answer questions from the DiSSCo UK community. The next of these is on 11th August. For access to recordings of past workshops, and a link to the upcoming workshop, please email dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk.  

If you have any questions about the funding call or digitisation programme, please direct them to infrastructure@ahrc.ukri.org or dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk.
