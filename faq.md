## What is DiSSCo UK?
DiSSCo UK is a partnership of institutions working together to harness the full potential of natural science collections through digitisation.  

This portal enables reliable knowledge and evidence about the natural world to be physically and digitally open, accessible, and usable for all forms of research and innovation.


## What data is included on this site?
GBIF (the Global Biodiversity Information Facility) is an open access infrastructure that aggregates biodiversity data from across the globe. This portal uses data uploaded to GBIF.

The ‘Specimens’ page provides specimen data uploaded to GBIF from UK institutions with an active GRSciColl (The Global Registry of Scientific Collections) record.  

The ‘Institutions’ page uses GRSciColl records and acts as a one-stop resource for UK natural science collections, improving the visibility of institutions.  


## What filters have been applied to the data included on the specimen page?
This portal is only comprised of data from natural science collections; for records to show on the portal, they must be either a material sample, fossil specimen, or preserved specimen. All live or observational data is excluded.

Data is only included if it is published by a UK based institution with an active GRSciColl record.  


## What filters have been applied to the data included on the institution page?


## Why do some non-UK institutions appear on the specimen pages?


## How do I add or update information about my institution?
To add your institution to the portal, you must create a GRSciColl record, which you can do [here](https://registry.gbif.org/institution/create).  

To update your existing institutional information, search for your institutional page on the [GBIF Registry](https://registry.gbif.org/institution/search?country=GB). On the entry you want to edit, press the ‘Suggest’ button at the top of the page and update the chosen fields. Once you have pressed ‘Save’, we will be able to accept the changes. Alternatively, you can email dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk with the adjustments you want made.


## Why are there fewer institutions on the DiSSCo UK dashboard compared to those listed on this site?
Some GRSciColl records may be out of date, with institutions potentially merging or becoming inactive. If you know a collection is no longer active or the information provided is incorrect, please let us know as we intend GRSciColl to be an up-to-date source for information on UK natural science collections.  

In addition, not all UK institutions completed the collections survey distributed in 2021. If you would like your collections data to be included in the [dashboard](https://bit.ly/dissco-uk), please contact dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk to be sent the survey.


## How do I request that my institution's details are removed from this site?
Please contact dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk to remove your institutional data from the portal. Institutions excluded from the portal will be listed in the ‘What filters have been applied’ question to inform all users of missing data/data caveats.


## How do I access observation data from the UK?
Observational data can be found on the [National Biodiversity Network (NBN) portal](https://nbnatlas.org/).


## How do I access information about geological specimens held in UK collections?
The needs of the Earth Sciences community cannot be met with this GBIF hosted portal, thus we are in the process of creating a separate portal for Earth Science collections data.


## My question isn't listed on this page - who can I contact for help?
Please contact dissco-uk@nhm.ac.uk.
